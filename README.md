# MHistory
# Purpose of the application 
The purpose of my application is for the user to be allowed to input their age and the application will display if a famous person has passed away at that age and a description of the person. It will also be pushed to Github and use GitHub actions to ensure that the code is running and if their is any faults it will pick up o those faults and notify me. 
# Design considerations 
My coding has met good programming standards and has the neccesary requiremnts to allow it to run such as a button to help process the information and a plain text to help the user input their age and a text view to help dislay the famous figure. 
# Utilisation of github and github actions
