# MHistory
# Purpose of the application 
The purpose of my application is for the user to be allowed to input their age and the application will display if a famous person has passed away at that age and a description of the person. It will also be pushed to Github and use GitHub actions to ensure that the code is running and if their is any faults it will pick up o those faults and notify me. 
# Design considerations 
My coding has met good programming standards and has the neccesary requiremnts to allow it to run such as a 2 buttons, the first one(calculate) is to help process the information and the second one(clear) it helps the user clear the information so the user doesnt have to hold down backspace. A plain text will be used to help the user input their age and a text view will be used to help dislay the famous figure and a description of the famous figure. 
I will be using kotlin to help program the application and use google to help search up the famous ffigures that have passed. 
The use of if statments will be used when coding the program so it will be easier instead of typing much longer codes. 
# Utilisation of github and github actions 
i will be using github actions to help test my code and ensure that it does not just work on only my computer and it can work on other computers and mobile devices. GitHub will also be used to help make sure that the application runs smoothly and insure that the user has an enjoable experience when using the application. GitHub will also be used to help type out a report that will explain the purpose of the application and provide the necessary information regarding the aplication and the procedures that were implemented.
# Refrences 
I used the manual to help me understand the assignment and program what is being asked for and i used google to help me search up famous figures that will be displayed when a specific age is inputted.
